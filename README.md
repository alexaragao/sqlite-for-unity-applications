# SQLite for Unity Applications

### by: Alexandre Arag√£o

## Project Information
A simple unity project that intenst to test SQLite3 in unity-compatible platforms. This project was developed in Unity **2019.3.10f**.

### Usage
Well, there is no real usage of this project. But it is useful for check platforms support of SQLite3. For use, just clone the project and open it with unity.

The application tests:
- SQLite Connection String
- SQLite Connection (and database file check)
- SQLite CREATE TABLE command
- SQLite INSERT INTO command
- SQLite UPDATE command
- SQLite DELETE command
- SQLite DROP TABLE command

### Useful information
This project don't use any plugin but SQLite3. Which means that Plugins folder only contains plugins for SQLite3, so you can copy the folder and paste it in any other project. Easy SQLite3.

## Interface explanation
The application has one main screen, that shows some system information and some SQLite functions.

</p>

When runnig the application you probaly won't see the screen as show Figure 1. Once the application starts, it will shows all colected data and informations. Then you will probaly see the screen as show Figure 2.

Of course, you can get an error, as shows Figure 3b.

  <div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between; width: 450px">

      <p align="center">
        <img src="imgs/android-success.jpeg" width="200" />
        <p>Figure 3a. SQLite success (Android).</p>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <p align="center">
        <img src="imgs/android-fail.jpeg" width="200" />
        <p>Figure 3b. SQLite fail (Android).</p>
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>
</p>
